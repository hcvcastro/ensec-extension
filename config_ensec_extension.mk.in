 # config variable for Ensec Extension
 # this file is intented to be able to be included in a Makefile
 # and not to be sourced in a shell session
 #

# Horrible hack to prepend spaces to expansions
# Spaces are usually eaten by make parser but not if variable expands to space.
# Space prefix is desirable because system CFLAGS may be completely empty,
# which means that the variables defined here would need extra twiddling
# to get them into invoked external configures and override pkg-config there.
